Since the numbers are consecutive and evenly spaced, I used the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1. In this case, the common difference is 1, so n = (999 - 100) / 1 + 1. Calculating this gives n = 900.', 'answer': 'B'}\nAnother solution: {'reasoning': 'To find the number of three-digit positive integers, I considered the range of numbers from 100 to 999. Since the integers are positive, we start from 100. The highest three-digit number is 999. To find the number of integers in this range, I subtracted the starting number from the ending number and added 1 to include both endpoints.
